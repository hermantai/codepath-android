# Notes

LiceCap has a bug that it does not work well with secondary screen. Whenever I
open it and at some point drag it to a secondary screen, whatever I record
after that will only record a black screen with marks for my cursor.
Re-recording a new one does not work either. The workaround is to re-open
LiceCap again and make sure it does not touch my secondary screen at any point
of its life.
